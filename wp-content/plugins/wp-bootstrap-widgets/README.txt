Configurable widgets for common Bootstrap components, including: alerts, buttons, responsive embeds, images, panels and wells.

== Description ==

WP Bootstrap Widgets provides configurable widgets for common [Twitter Bootstrap (version 3)](https://getbootstrap.com/) components. If your theme is based on Bootstrap, these widgets will automatically look great! Works particularly well with the [SiteOrigin Page Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/siteorigin-panels/) as you can drop your widgets into your multi-column layouts with ease.

Included widgets:

  - [Alerts](https://getbootstrap.com/components/#alerts)
  - [Button](https://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons)
  - [Image](https://getbootstrap.com/css/#images)
  - [Navigation Bar](https://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar)
  - [Responsive Embed](https://getbootstrap.com/components/#responsive-embed)
  - [Panels](https://getbootstrap.com/components/#panels)
  - [Wells](https://getbootstrap.com/components/#wells)

All widgets are configurable (choose from `primary`, `success`, `info`, etc).

== Installation ==

  1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-bootstrap-widgets` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
  2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
  3. Go to **Appearance > Widgets** to add to your site's sidebar, or if you're using the SiteOrigin Page Builder, choose the Page Builder on any page and choose from the "Bootstrap Widgets" section.
